    <h2>Biden to unveil new proposal for sweeping spending deal, expects to win full Democratic support</h2>
    <h3><img src="imagefornews.JFIF"></h3>
    <p>
        WASHINGTON â€” President Joe Biden expects to get full Democratic support when he unveils
        a new framework Thursday
        </p>
        <p> for the sweeping social safety net package that includes
        money for child care and climate change, senior administration officials said.
    </p>
    <p> But he may face an uphill struggle when he meets with leery lawmakers who have watched
        their priorities dwindle from the package during months of haggling.
    </p>
    <p>
        Biden is expected to travel to Capitol Hill to huddle behind closed doors in the morning
        with House Democrats to present the parameters of the package.
    </p>
    <p> He is then expected to deliver remarks at the White House in the late morning and is scheduled to leave for his
        trip to Europe
        in the midafternoon.
