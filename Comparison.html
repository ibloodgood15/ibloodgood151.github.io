        <p>Since we have looked at both HTML and CSS in Web Design this year, let's take a moment to compare them. Here are some similarities and differences between HTML and CSS.</p>

        <h2 id="similarities">Similarities</h2>
        <h3 id="similarCategory1">Opening and saving</h3>
        <ul id = "similarCategory1List">
            <li>Both HTML and CSS are saved as plain text and can be typed using a simple program like Notepad.</li>
            <li>HTML and CSS are usually saved in the same directory (or folder) so that they can work together.</li>
            <li>Both HTML and CSS can be accessed on the Internet using HTTP.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="similarCategory2">What is in them</h3>
        <ul id = "similarCategory2List">
            <li>HTML and CSS understand the same elements (h1, br, etc.).</li>
            <li>Both HTML and CSS provide ways for you to put in comments (notes for yourself) in the file that do not affect how the final page looks.</li>
            <li>Both use the hash symbol (#) to represent an ID to look up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="similarCategory3">Formatting</h3>
        <p>Some older, deprecated HTML elements overlap in purpose with CSS.</p>
        <ul id = "similarCategory3List">
            <li>The &lt;b&gt; element makes things bold, like <code>font-weight: bold</code>.</li>
            <li>The &lt;small&gt; element makes things smaller, like <code>font-size: smaller</code>.</li>
            <li>The &lt;center&gt; element (officially gone now, but it probably still works) centers text horizontally, like <code>text-align: center</code>.</li>
        </ul>
