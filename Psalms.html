1 The Lord is my light and my salvation—
    whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the stronghold of my life—
    of whom shall I be afraid?<br>
2 When the wicked advance against me
    to devour me,
it is my enemies and my foes
    who will stumble and fall.<br>
3 Though an army besiege me,
    my heart will not fear;
though war break out against me,
    even then I will be confident.<br>
4 One thing I ask from the Lord,
    this only do I seek:
that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
    all the days of my life,
to gaze on the beauty of the Lord
    and to seek him in his temple.<br>
5 For in the day of trouble
    he will keep me safe in his dwelling;
he will hide me in the shelter of his sacred tent
    and set me high upon a rock.<br>
6 Then my head will be exalted
    above the enemies who surround me;
at his sacred tent I will sacrifice with shouts of joy;
    I will sing and make music to the Lord.<br>
7 Hear my voice when I call, Lord;
    be merciful to me and answer me.<br>
8 My heart says of you, “Seek his face!”
    Your face, Lord, I will seek.<br>
9 Do not hide your face from me,
    do not turn your servant away in anger;
    you have been my helper.
Do not reject me or forsake me,
    God my Savior.<br>
10 Though my father and mother forsake me,
    the Lord will receive me.<br>
11 Teach me your way, Lord;
    lead me in a straight path
    because of my oppressors.<br>
12 Do not turn me over to the desire of my foes,
    for false witnesses rise up against me,
    spouting malicious accusations.<br>
13 I remain confident of this:
    I will see the goodness of the Lord
    in the land of the living.<br>
14 Wait for the Lord;
    be strong and take heart
    and wait for the Lord.

        1 Do not fret because of those who are evil
            or be envious of those who do wrong;<br>
        2 for like the grass they will soon wither,
            like green plants they will soon die away.<br>
        3 Trust in the Lord and do good;
            dwell in the land and enjoy safe pasture.<br>
        4 Take delight in the Lord,
            and he will give you the desires of your heart.<br>
        5 Commit your way to the Lord;
            trust in him and he will do this:<br>
        6 He will make your righteous reward shine like the dawn,
            your vindication like the noonday sun.<br>
        7 Be still before the Lord
            and wait patiently for him;
        do not fret when people succeed in their ways,
            when they carry out their wicked schemes.<br>
        8 Refrain from anger and turn from wrath;
            do not fret—it leads only to evil.<br>
        9 For those who are evil will be destroyed,
            but those who hope in the Lord will inherit the land.<br>
        10 A little while, and the wicked will be no more;
            though you look for them, they will not be found.<br>
        11 But the meek will inherit the land
            and enjoy peace and prosperity.<br>
        12 The wicked plot against the righteous
            and gnash their teeth at them;<br>
        13 but the Lord laughs at the wicked,
            for he knows their day is coming.<br>
        14 The wicked draw the sword
            and bend the bow
        to bring down the poor and needy,
            to slay those whose ways are upright.<br>
        15 But their swords will pierce their own hearts,
            and their bows will be broken.<br>
        16 Better the little that the righteous have
            than the wealth of many wicked;<br>
        17 for the power of the wicked will be broken,
            but the Lord upholds the righteous.<br>
        18 The blameless spend their days under the Lord’s care,
            and their inheritance will endure forever.<br>
        19 In times of disaster they will not wither;
            in days of famine they will enjoy plenty.<br>
        20 But the wicked will perish:
            Though the Lord’s enemies are like the flowers of the field,
            they will be consumed, they will go up in smoke.<br>
        21 The wicked borrow and do not repay,
            but the righteous give generously;<br>
        22 those the Lord blesses will inherit the land,
            but those he curses will be destroyed.<br>
        23 The Lord makes firm the steps
            of the one who delights in him;<br>
        24 though he may stumble, he will not fall,
            for the Lord upholds him with his hand.<br>
        25 I was young and now I am old,
            yet I have never seen the righteous forsaken
            or their children begging bread.<br>
        26 They are always generous and lend freely;
            their children will be a blessing.[b]<br>
        27 Turn from evil and do good;
            then you will dwell in the land forever.<br>
        28 For the Lord loves the just
            and will not forsake his faithful ones.
        Wrongdoers will be completely destroyed[c];
            the offspring of the wicked will perish.<br>
        29 The righteous will inherit the land
            and dwell in it forever.<br>
        30 The mouths of the righteous utter wisdom,
            and their tongues speak what is just.<br>
        31 The law of their God is in their hearts;
            their feet do not slip.<br>
        32 The wicked lie in wait for the righteous,
            intent on putting them to death;<br>
        33 but the Lord will not leave them in the power of the wicked
            or let them be condemned when brought to trial.<br>
        34 Hope in the Lord
            and keep his way.
        He will exalt you to inherit the land;
            when the wicked are destroyed, you will see it.<br>
        35 I have seen a wicked and ruthless man
            flourishing like a luxuriant native tree,<br>
        36 but he soon passed away and was no more;
            though I looked for him, he could not be found.<br>
        37 Consider the blameless, observe the upright;
            a future awaits those who seek peace.<br>
        38 But all sinners will be destroyed;
            there will be no future[e] for the wicked.<br>
        39 The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord;
            he is their stronghold in time of trouble.<br>
        40 The Lord helps them and delivers them;
            he delivers them from the wicked and saves them,
            because they take refuge in him.
